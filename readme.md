A Simple PHPUnit Example
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zaifastafa/simple-unit-test.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zaifastafa/simple-unit-test)

This is a simple example of unit testing in PHP with PHPUnit. 

Please feel free to download this repository and give the unit tests a try.

You can build upon this further after cloning the repository and adding more tests and methods as you see fit.

Try taking a test driven development (TDD) approach to adding a new method to `Average` class for calculating the mode by writing a test first.

Getting Started
---------------

Clone this repository and then run Composer:-

```
composer install
```

You will then be able to run the unit tests using:-

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
